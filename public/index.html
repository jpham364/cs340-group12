            <p>In the past few years, gyms and fitness centers have been negatively affected by the pandemic due to their closures, which has caused a pause in the fitness industry. The result is an increase in home gyms so that people can still get a workout from the comfort of their homes. Customers that invest in a gym also invest in their well-being and health.<br><br> 

            Our client is Strength Solutions Supply, a gym equipment company that caters to home and commercial gyms as they begin to open. The company makes around $750,000 in sales every year. To keep track of sales, a database is used to track equipment orders (Orders). It can also track inventory, customer information, orders, and equipment details (Equipment) to ensure organization in a large-scale business as the website gets around 300+ visitors a day. <br><br>

            The company has a range of 5 equipment types from weight machines, free weights, cardio, home-gym systems, and accessories. With these equipment types, the gym supply warehouse has about 200 items in their inventory to be shipped in a moment's notice. These categories of fitness equipment will be categorized (ProductType).  In addition, users can write reviews and give ratings on the equipment in a scale of 1-5 stars on the website and those reviews will be stored in the database as well (Reviews). The users can browse around the website and observe the equipment being purchased along with user information. </p>
